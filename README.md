# peer-review
A peer review site for coding.

## Purpose
This was an excercise, basically. I wanted to create a site with login functionality and practice querying and displaying database information.
It's not much but I learned a lot about writing unorganized, crap PHP. The whole thing ended up being so messy that I began looking into Laravel and have been learning that ever since.
